# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `.next`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Vercel Configuration

Create `vercel.json` (optional):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Browser Support
- **Voice Recognition**: Limited in Firefox and Safari (browser limitation)
- **Continuous Listening**: Not supported in Safari
- **Service Worker**: Not supported in IE11 (not a target browser)

### Feature Limitations
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Requires internet connection
- **Voice Recognition**: Requires internet (browser limitation)
- **SMS/WhatsApp**: Opens native apps, doesn't send automatically (by design)
- **Alert History**: Stored locally only (no cloud sync)

### Mobile Considerations
- **iOS Safari**: Limited Web Speech API support
- **iOS Safari**: Service worker may not activate in Private Browsing
- **Android**: Full support in Chrome

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**Error**: `Module not found`
```bash
# Solution: Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Error**: `Type errors in build`
```bash
# Solution: Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit
# Fix any type errors shown
```

### Runtime Errors

**Service Worker Not Registering**
- Check console for errors
- Ensure HTTPS (required for SW)
- Clear browser cache
- Check `public/sw.js` exists

**Voice Commands Not Working**
- Check microphone permissions
- Use Chrome/Edge for best support
- Check browser console for errors
